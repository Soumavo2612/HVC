# HVC
This project was aimed at making a hybrid vehicle which runs on both the fuel and electrical energy. My team was given the task of designing the innovation sector and electrical engineering including the motor and the batteries.
This repository consists of code inplemented using Arduino IDE to be used in the dashboard of the vehicle.
